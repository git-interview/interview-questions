## Problem statement
{: .d-inline-block } 
For candidate 
{: .label .label-green }


Our goal is to design and implement a simplified webcrawler. The system should accept an initial webpage to crawl, such as:

```
https://apple.com
```

from which it should progressively discover all linked pages. To limit the amount of work performed by the crawler, it should accept a maximum number of distinct pages to visit, for example, `50`.

As the crawler visits pages, it should build a general representation of how pages link to each other. Upon completion, it should print the complete list of pages visited, sorted by decreasing *in-degree* (ie, how many pages link to it). For example:

```
URL                                    IN-DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------
https://apple.com/us/search                44
https://www.icloud.com                     42
https://support.apple.com                  36
https://apple.com/us/shop/goto/bag         35
https://apple.com/ipad                     34
https://apple.com/watch                    34
https://apple.com/tv                       34
https://apple.com/music                    34
https://apple.com/mac                      34
https://apple.com/iphone                   34
...
```
