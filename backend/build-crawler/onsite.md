## Scenario
{: .d-inline-block }
During onsite
{: .label .label-green }

Our goal is to design a simplified webcrawler. The system should accept an initial webpage to crawl, such as:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth
```

from which it should progressively discover all linked pages. To limit the amount of work performed by the crawler, it should accept a maximum number of distinct pages to visit, for example, `1000`.

As the crawler visits pages, it should build a general representation of how pages link to each other. Upon completion, it should print the complete list of pages visited, sorted by decreasing *in-degree* (ie, how many pages link to it). For example:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun   18
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion   12
...
```
